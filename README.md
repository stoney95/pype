From local functions to cloud deployed pipelines - build pipelines in a functional manner. This package simplifies and streamlines the development of pipelines. You can start locally and deploy the pipelines later using your favorite framework. Further benefits are:

- You don't lock your pipelines into a framework. You can even convert your `pypely` code to the framework of your desire. 
- The dependencies for each step are detected automatically. So, you don't need to manage the dependencies.
- The compatability of steps is checked during buildtime. Errors are catch as early as possible.
- You keep your pipelines easily testable.
