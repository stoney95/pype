# Data Objects
This tutorial showcases how you can use custom immutable objects in combination with `pypely`. The example demonstrates how a simple morning routine could be modeled - you may know some code snippets from the documentation. 

Notice: The classes in the example don't have functionality (no methods), they simple act as data containers. All functionality that manipulates the state of objects is implemented by functions. By this data and functionality is clearly separated. 

## Execution
Please be sure that you ran `source .path` before you start [morning_routine.py](src/morning_routine.py). [.path](../../.path) is located in the root of the project.
