# Examples
In this directory are some examples that will showcase how to apply `pypely`:

* [data_objects](./data_objects/): This example is the implementation of the documentation code snippets. It showcases how `pypely` can be used in combination with custom created immutable data objects.
* **[preprocessing](.preprocessing/)**: This example applies the `pypely` approach to different kaggle data preprocessing examples. **These examples represent the majority of use cases `pypely` can be applied to.**

> :mailbox: If you find the approaches in the examples interesting and have feedback, criticisms or questions please feel free to open an issue or contact me directly. 

> :warning: If you want to execute the examples please run `source .path` as this will set the correct `PYTHONPATH`. You can also run the command from any subdirectory as long as you update the path to [.path](../.path) respectively.
