# Nice that you are here!
I'm very glad that you are interested in contributing to this project. Please follow this guide as there are some rules. 

## Conventional Commits

> :warning: Be sure to read this section. A bot is installed that will deny your pull request if there are no commits in the format of Conventional Commit.

The project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to automatically detect project versions. Please read the linked guide to understand [Conventional Commits (CC)](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Also you should install a pre-commit hook, that ensures that you are using CC. To do so use the project [sailr](https://github.com/craicoverflow/sailr). The config is already given in the repository. 

An other alternative is to use [this](https://github.com/compilerla/conventional-pre-commit). But this only works on systems supporting `grep -P`. It does not work on MacOS.
