# Examples
In this directory are some examples that will showcase how to apply `pypely`. For this three kaggle challenges will be used as a base. The code written in the examples is inspired by the referenced notebooks. The purpose of the examples ca not be compared with the original purpose of the notebook code. All visualizations will be left out. You can understand the translation from the notebook to the example as if you did exploration and want to transform your code into a productive, reusable and extendable setup.
